And it's not okay ðŸ¥¹..but things are going to be better:) You know, in the kind of way where you just want to spend time with your favorite person? Where you know that no matter what happens, you got each other to get you through it. That the little nonverbals that we share, end up creating new memories that we can look back on and giggle at from time to time. The funny smirks, the subtle eye rolls or wide eyes. The belly rubs and the power naps from eating too much. When you realize you can look up and see your person from across the room, when something happens, instead of wanting to call... because you're in the same room. And the smile that stretches across our faces, the warmth that spreads through our chests, and the yearning to cross the room and experience it together, hand in hand. I want to take pictures and look through them together and talk about how much fun we had in those moments. I want your arms I'm around me, and mine around you. I want to be able to walk across the room and hold you, kiss your lips, and share those little moments with you. To hug you tight until you feel comfortable...that's all I can dream of:)"
